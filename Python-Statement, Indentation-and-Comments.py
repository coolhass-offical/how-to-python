# Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements.

# But we can make a statement extend over multiple lines with the line continuation character (\).
b = 1 + 2 + 3 +\

    5 + 6 + 7

# In Python, line continuation is implied inside parentheses ( ), brackets [ ], and braces { }.

# The surrounding parentheses ( ) do the line continuation implicitly. Same is the case with [ ] and { }.

# We can also put multiple statements in a single line using semicolons.
