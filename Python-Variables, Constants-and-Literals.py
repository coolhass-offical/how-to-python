# A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory.
# It is helpful to think of variables as a container
# that holds data that can be changed later in the program.

number = 10

print(number)

# You can think of variables as a bag to store books in it
# and that book can be replaced at any time.

number = 20
print(number)

number = 19
print(number)

'''Note: In Python, we don't actually assign values to the variables. 
Instead, Python gives the reference of the object(value) to the variable.'''

# As you can see from the above example,
# you can use the assignment operator = to assign a value to a variable.

website = "python.org"
print(website)

website = "github.com"
print(website)

# Assigning multiple values to multiple variables

a, b, c = 1, 3.14, "Whoo"
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# If we want to assign the same value to multiple variables at once, we can do this

x, y, z = "same"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# Assigning value to constant in Python

'''this will be in the constant.py and main.py'''
